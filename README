Description

Nabla is a compact GNU/Linux image for a few selected hardware configurations. Currently PC Engines Alix2, Raspberry Pi 4, Intel 32 and 64 bit are supported. Recommended hardware is Intel 64 bit and Raspberry Pi 4. Intel 32 bit will be discontinued in the future. 

In addition to this repository, a Buildroot installation is required to generate Nabla images. 

Resulting firmware images can be started via syslinux or isolinux from a USB stick or SD card and run completely within a ram disk. Configurations will be read from /written back to a hidden directory on the boot device. 

Nabla uses mpd for music playback and can access local hard drives or remote directories via NFS or SMB. Filesystems must be mounted locally to be accessible. USB drives are recognized and mounted automatically. 


Configuration

Buildroot configurations exist for selected hardware platforms. The configs directory contains Buildroot defconfig files that can be used to initialize the build system with the cross-compile settings and kernel configurations for that hardware. 

  Active configurations:
  alix2_defconfig			PC Engines ALIX2 [1]
  generic_i386_defconfig	32-bit Intel boards, Core2 or newer
  generic_x86-64_defconfig	64-bit Intel Boards, Core2 or newer [2]
  raspberrypi_defconfig		Raspberry 4 Model B [3]


Image build

Prepare the build machine, see https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement

Download Buildroot from https://buildroot.org/download.html and unpack into ./buildroot
  $ wget https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2021.02.6.tar.bz2
  $ tar xf buildroot-2021.02.6.tar.bz2 ./buildroot

Clone Nabla repository to use as Buildroot external tree
  $ git clone https://github.com/aeolio/Nabla.git br2-external

Create output directory and initialize build system. Select the defconfig file from the list under 'Configuration'
  $ mkdir nabla
  $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=$PWD/br2-external/ -C $PWD/buildroot/ O=$PWD/nabla generic_x86-64_defconfig

Build firmware image
  $ cd nabla
  $ make


Installation

Write the final sdcard.img found in nabla/images to a USB stick. If the resulting device should not be bootable, check if syslinux is present on your build system. If necessary, re-install syslinux on the image file and write it to your USB stick. 
  $ syslinux --install nabla/images/sdcard.img

Raspberry Pi does not use image files; transfer the files in the folder rpi-firmware plus the files bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb, Image, rootfs.cpio.gz to a FAT32 formatted microSD card instead. 


Upgrade

Using a terminal, connect via ssh to the embedded system and make the boot partition writeable:
  $ ssh nabla
  [nabla]# mount -o remount,rw /media/boot

Using a file browser, connect via sftp to the embedded system and copy bzImage (for Raspberry Pi: bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb, Image, rootfs.cpio.gz) to the boot partition mounted on /media/boot. 

Now reboot the machine from the terminal session:
  [nabla]# reboot


Caveat

Currently the Alix2 image is configured to be used as a mpd server, the Raspberry Pi image as a mpd client. For standalone installations (database and player on one machine) the mpd build options need to be adapted. 


Footnotes

[1] This machine is hopelessly outdated, but since it performs quite well, it is still supported
[2] SoC based mainboards, like J1800 and J1900 were found to perform well as music players
[3] Only Raspberry 4 is supported, older models did show very poor scheduling jitter results, so were discontinued
