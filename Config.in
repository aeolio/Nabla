# mpd client uses BR2_PACKAGE_MPD_MAD for playback and

# mpd standalone needs both BR2_PACKAGE_MPD_MPG123 and BR2_PACKAGE_MPD_MAD
# both server and standalone can use liburing for async access to local files
# playback functionality requires alsa

# introduce 'unconfigured' option to avoid errors during test builds
